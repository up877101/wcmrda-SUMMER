code that runs on the raspberry pi along with tests lives here

ssh into the pi with: 'ssh __@___.___.___.___'
the login password is '_____'

1/12/2019 - enabled I2C on the Pi, changed the baud rate to 400Mhz. 

The raspberry pi needs several pieces of base software
it needs installed and update:
- python3 and its dev packages
- pip3 for package management for python3
- opencv 4 - built from binaries or done using a shell script
- scipy packages such as numpy
- python3-smbus

dependencies.sh does not include the downloading and installing of OpenCV since
I think both machines already have 4.1.1 installed

the image passing library that is used on the pi is imagezmq
on the pi system it needs to be installed along with its dependencies
use pip3 to get the necessary packages:
- opencv-contrib-python
- zmq
- imutils

get the imagezmq repository from github
    git clone https://github.com/jeffbass/imagezmq.git

(you can then place imagezmq in the project folder in which you will use it
 not however that it is better to sym-link it into your virtual environment)

refer to this guide for setup and function of image passing:
